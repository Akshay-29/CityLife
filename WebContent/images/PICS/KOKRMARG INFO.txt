Kokernag

Situated in the heart of Bringhi valley, Kokernag (2,020 m, 70 kms from Srinagar), is set amidst sprawling gardens fragrant with the bloom of thousands of flowers. The Kokernag spring bubbles at seven places at the foot of the forested mountain. The water of the spring is famous for its medicinal and digestive properties.

The spring gushes out of the base of a thickly wooded hill from where it separates into channels which bear an uncanny resemblance to the claw-foot of a hen, hence its name.
The great Mughal historian, Abul Fazl, has chronicled for posterity the benefits of the sweet water spring of Kokernag. This beneficent gift of nature is still regarded as having extraordinary healing powers and the sick are brought here for treatment by its waters and solitude. Kokernag is also known therefore, and most aptly, as Papashudan Nag or sin-cleansing spring.

 Kokernag, whether it is to drink of its curative waters or breathe in the fragrance and quiet beauty of its gardens, remains one of the loveliest of all the springs in this verdant valley. Accommodation is available at well furnished cottages and rooms at reasonable rates. Excursions can be made to Daksum, Achhabal, and Verinag.
